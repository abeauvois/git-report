### How to compile

```bash
# install the js compiler
yarn global add pkg

# run the compiler for your architecture (see details here: https://github.com/vercel/pkg)
 yarn build
```

### How to execute

```bash
 yarn exec

OR
# copy all files in ./bin
cp ./bin/ /usr/local/bin/

```

## How to create a CSV file with a line of headers (in /csv folder)

```bash
 > echo sha, contributor, date, message > ./csv/gitlog.csv
```

- Append the CSV file with git log output, filtered by your `git username`

```bash
 > git log --date=local --pretty=format:'%h, %an, %ad, "%s"' | egrep {YOUR GIT USERNAME} >> ./csv/gitlog.csv

```

## 1. For a report in the terminal's console:

```bash
yarn start console ./csv/real-world-git-log.csv -v

# use your own csv file (produced by the git log command above)
yarn start console ./csv/{your_csv_file} -v
```

**You should see the following result in the terminal:**

## 2. For a report sent by email to yourself (via gmail):

It requires some devOps skills if you want to use `gmail` to send this report by email with it.

### Create an .env file (same place as package.json)

First, as we're using `gmail`, we have to setup a Google cloud project and get some key informations

Follow these instructions: https://medium.com/@nickroach_50526/sending-emails-with-node-js-using-smtp-gmail-and-oauth2-316fe9c790a1

The article explains `Why using Oauth2 and Google Dev App`

> many solutions required to go into my account settings and Enable Less Secure Apps. That sounded way too scary for me, especially considering I had been saved by Googleâ€™s security measures on more than a few occasions.
> So I found more efficient setting up OAuth2 for a Google Developer application and connecting it to the Nodemailer module using SMTP.

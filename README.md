## 2. For a report in by email via gmail to yourself:

It requires some devOps skills if you want to use `gmail` to send this report by email with it.

### Create an .env file (same place as package.json)

First, as we're using `gmail`, we have to setup a Google cloud project and get some key informations

```bash
API_KEY=
API_SECRET=
GMAIL_EMAIL=
GMAIL_PASSWORD=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

### Create a CSV file with a line of headers (in /csv folder)

```

### Append the CSV file with git log, filtered by your `git username`

```bash

```

## Send
